About
-----
New Horizons is a planet pack for Kerbal Space Program. Originally designed as a small project to help KillAshley get back into the game.

This expansion retextures all stock bodies to bring them into higher resolution, matching their textures with the ones used by New Horizons.

Instructions
------------
Simply merge the downloaded .zip files into your KSP directory the same as with any other mod.
DO NOT EXTRACT THE .zip FILE STRAIGHT OUT - open it and merge the contents.
This should be all you are required to do for a basic install.


Optional Extras
---------------
New Horizons aims to expand and overhaul the entire solar system, and as such there are a few optional extras not included in the main release that could significantly improve your gameplay.

Custom E.V.E. Cloud Layers
- Adds custom volumetric cloud layers and atmosphere effects to all 35 bodies
	
Vanilla Bodies Texture Overhauls
- Re-textures all stock bodies into a HD style that matches the New Horizons planets
	
Community Resource Pack Compatibility
- Adds support for custom resources for mods such as the USI catalogue, Extra-Planetary Launchpads & many more.
